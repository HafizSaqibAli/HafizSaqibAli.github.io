abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases with progressive cellular loss of the central nervous system and elusive disease etiology provide a continuous impetus to explore drug discovery programmes aiming at identifying robust and effective inhibitors of cholinesterase and monoamine oxidase enzymes. We herein present a concise library of anthranilamide derivatives involving a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction to install the diverse structural diversity required for the desired biological action. Using Ellman's method, cholinesterase inhibitory activity was performed against AChE and BuChE enzymes. In vitro assay results demonstrated that anthranilamides are potent inhibitors with remarkable potency. Compound 6k emerged as the lead candidate and dual inhibitor of both enzymes with IC50 values of 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.49 ± 0.02 μM against AChE and BuChE, respectively. Several other compounds were found as highly potent and selective inhibitors. Anthranilamide derivatives were also tested against monoamine oxidase (A and B) enzymes using fluorometric method. In vitro data revealed compound 6h as the most potent inhibitor against MAO-A, showing an IC50 value of 0.44 ± 0.02 μM, whereas, compound 6k emerged as the top inhibitor of MAO-B with an IC50 value of 0.06 ± 0.01 μM. All the lead inhibitors were analyzed for the identification of their mechanism of action using Michaelis-Menten kinetics experiments. Compound 6k and 6h depicted a competitive mode of action against AChE and MAO-A, whereas, a non-competitive and mixed-type of inhibition was observed against BuChE and MAO-B by compounds 6k. Molecular docking analysis revealed remarkable binding affinities of the potent inhibitors with specific residues inside the active site of receptors. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the ability of potent compounds to form energetically stable complexes with the target protein. Finally, in silico ADME calculations also demonstrated that the potent compounds exhibit promising pharmacokinetic profile, satisfying the essential criteria for drug-likeness. Altogether, the findings reported in the current work clearly suggest that the identified anthranilamide derivatives have the potential to serve as effective drug candidates for future investigations.}
