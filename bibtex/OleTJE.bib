abstract  ="Cytochrome P450 enzymes are versatile biocatalysts found in most forms of life. Generally{,} the cytochrome P450s react with dioxygen and hence are haem-based mono-oxygenases; however{,} in specific isozymes{,} H2O2 rather than O2 is used and these P450s act as peroxygenases. The P450 OleTJE is a peroxygenase that binds long to medium chain fatty acids and converts them to a range of products originating from Cα-hydroxylation{,} Cβ-hydroxylation{,} Cα–Cβ desaturation and decarboxylation of the substrate. There is still controversy regarding the details of the reaction mechanism of P450 OleTJE; how the products are formed and whether the product distributions can be influenced by external perturbations. To gain further insights into the structure and reactivity of P450 OleTJE{,} we set up a range of large active site model complexes as well as full enzymatic structures and did a combination of density functional theory studies and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. In particular{,} the work focused on the mechanisms leading to these products under various reaction conditions. Thus{,} for a small cluster model{,} we find a highly selective Cα-hydroxylation pathway that is preferred over Cβ–H hydrogen atom abstraction by at least 10 kcal mol−1. Introduction of polar residues to the model{,} such as an active site protonated histidine residue or through external electric field effects{,} lowers the Cβ–H hydrogen atom abstraction barriers are lowered{,} while a full QM/MM model brings the Cα–H and Cβ–H hydrogen atom abstraction barriers within 1 kcal mol−1. Our studies; therefore{,} implicate that environmental effects in the second-coordination sphere can direct and guide selectivities in enzymatic reaction mechanisms."}
