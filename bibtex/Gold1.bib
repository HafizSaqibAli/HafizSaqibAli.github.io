abstract  ="N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(i)-catalyzed organic synthesis has recently been receiving increasing attention{,} especially with the activation of alkynes. In contrast{,} counteranions{,} being widely problematic in Au(i)-catalyzed transformations{,} are commonly considered as innocent partners and are not respectably included in a computational model. Herein{,} we report density functional theory (DFT) investigations of the Au(i)-catalyzed cyclization of propargylic amides to exploit the mechanistic effect of several counteranions to shed some light for further future developments. Among the counteranions used in this study{,} NTf2−{,} ClO4−{,} TsO−{,} TFA−{,} TfO−{,} MsO−{,} and SbF6−{,} both the cyclization and protodeauration step favor the 5-exo-dig product over the 6-endo-dig product when the alkyne moiety is terminated with hydrogen. These anions reveal a crucial influence on the energy profile through lowering the barriers of the reaction. Mechanistically{,} the results obtained from all counteranions show that the protodeauration is slower than the cyclization. By using an energetic span model{,} the results clearly indicate that the rate-determining state is the protodeauration step for all counteranions{,} and thus protodeauration is the turnover-limiting step. The turnover frequency (TOF) results for the formation of the 5-exo-dig product show cyclization reactivity in the order of MsO− > TFA− > ClO4− > NTf2− > TfO− > TsO− ≫ SbF6−{,} whereas an order of TFA− > MsO− > NTf2− > TfO− ≈ ClO4− > SbF6− ⋙ TsO− is calculated for the protodeauration{,} suggesting that SbF6− and TsO− are disfavored due to their slow protodeauration. In this regard{,} and for the 6-endo-dig pathway{,} our conclusions demonstrate an order of TfO− > TFA− > MsO− > NTf2− > ClO4− > TsO− ⋙ SbF6− for the cyclization and TFA− > TsO− > MsO− > TfO− > NTf2− > ClO4− ⋙ SbF6− for the protodeauration{,} advocating that the anions SbF6−{,} NTf2− and ClO4− are unlikely partners for the 6-endo-dig pathway because of their slow protodeauration. Finally{,} the findings here advise that any engineering of the counteranion to increase the efficiency of catalytic system would be more effective on the protodeauration step rather than the cyclization step."}
