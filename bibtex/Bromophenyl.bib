abstract = {Abstract 2-Aminothiazole is a valuable synthon in organic synthesis and an important structural unit of pharmaceutically active drugs. It is accessible via several synthetic routes. In the current account, compound 4 {4-(4-bromophenyl) thiazol-2-amine} was synthesized by employing a recently reported procedure of Gabriel synthesis using Lawesson reagent. The title compound was characterized through spectro-elemental analytical data, and its crystal structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The torsion angles, bond lengths, and bond strengths between the planes of the thiazole and phenyl rings were optimized by theoretical calculations by applying the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level for the purpose of investigating the conformational effects on the stabilization of the crystal packing. HOMO-LUMO analysis, vibrational analysis, and thermodynamic parameters were also investigated. A detailed analysis of the intermolecular interactions of thiazole moiety bearing the amino and bromophenyl ring has been performed based on the Hirshfeld surfaces and their associated two-dimensional fingerprint plots. The relative contributions of the main intermolecular contacts as well as the enrichment ratios derived from the Hirshfeld surface analysis establish the 2-aminothiazole synthon to be a molecule of great interest. DNA binding studies pointed towards anticancer potency of the synthesized compound via reversible binding.},
