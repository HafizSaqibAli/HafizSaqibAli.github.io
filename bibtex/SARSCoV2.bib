abstract = {The coronavirus, a subfamily of the coronavirinae family, is an RNA virus with over 40 variations that can infect humans, non-human mammals and birds. There are seven types of human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The current study is focused on the identification of drug molecules for the treatment of COVID-19 by targeting human proteases like transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), furin, cathepsin B, and a nuclear receptor named farnesoid X receptor (FXR). TMPRSS2 and furin help in cleaving the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while cathepsin B plays a critical role in the entry and pathogenesis. FXR, on the other hand, regulates the expression of ACE2, and its inhibition can reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection. By inhibiting these four protein targets with non-toxic inhibitors, the entry of the infectious agent into host cells and its pathogenesis can be obstructed. We have used the BioSolveIT suite for pharmacophore-based computational drug designing. A total of 1611 ligands from the ligand library were docked with the target proteins to obtain potent inhibitors on the basis of pharmacophore. Following the ADMET analysis and protein ligand interactions, potent and druggable inhibitors of the target proteins were obtained. Additionally, toxic substructures and the less toxic route of administration of the most potent inhibitors in rodents were also determined computationally. Compounds namely N-(diaminomethylene)-2-((3-((1R,3R)-3-(2-(methoxy(methyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)cyclopentyl)propyl)amino)-2-oxoethan-1-aminium (26), (1R,3R)-3-(((2-ammonioethyl)ammonio)methyl)-1-((4-propyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-1-ium (29) and (1R,3R)-3-(((2-ammonioethyl)ammonio)methyl)-1-((1-propyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methyl)piperidin-1-ium (30) were found as the potent inhibitors of TMPRSS2, whereas, 1-(1-(1-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)cyclopropane-1‑carbonyl)piperidin-4-yl)azepan-2-one (6), (2R)-4-methyl-1-oxo-1-((7R,11S)-4-oxo-6,7,8,9,10,11-hexahydro-4H-7,11-methanopyrido[1,2-a]azocin-9-yl)pentan-2-aminium (12), 4-((1-(3-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)propanoyl)piperidin-4-yl)methyl)morpholin-4-ium (13), 1-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)-N-(3-oxocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine-4-carboxamide (14), 1-(4-(1,5-dimethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)propan-1-one (25) and N,N-dimethyl-4-oxo-4-((1S,5R)-8-oxo-5,6-dihydro-1H-1,5-methanopyrido[1,2-a][1,5]diazocin-3(2H,4H,8H)-yl)butanamide (31) inhibited the FXR preferentially. In case of cathepsin B, N-((5-benzoylthiophen-2-yl)methyl)-2-hydrazineyl-2-oxoacetamide (2) and N-([2,2′-bifuran]-5-ylmethyl)-2-hydrazineyl-2-oxoacetamide (7) were identified as the most druggable inhibitors whereas 1-amino-2,7-diethyl-3,8-dioxo-6-(p-tolyl)-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-2,7-naphthyridine-4‑carbonitrile (5) and (R)-6-amino-2-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione (20) were active against furin.}
