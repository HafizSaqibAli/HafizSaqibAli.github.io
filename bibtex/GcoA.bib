abstract = {Abstract A recently characterized cytochrome P450 isozyme GcoA activates lignin components through a selective O-demethylation or alternatively an acetal formation reaction. These are important reactions in biotechnology and, because lignin is readily available; it being the main component in plant cell walls. In this work we present a density functional theory study on a large active site model of GcoA to investigate syringol activation by an iron(IV)-oxo heme cation radical oxidant (Compound I) leading to hemiacetal and acetal products. Several substrate-binding positions were tested and full energy landscapes calculated. The study shows that substrate positioning determines the product distributions. Thus, with the phenol group pointing away from the heme, an O-demethylation is predicted, whereas an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction of the weak phenolic O-H group would trigger a pathway leading to ring-closure to form acetal products. Predictions on how to engineer P450 GcoA to get more selective product distributions are given.},
